Hello there, Iâ€™m an computer engineering graduate from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Nepal. I currenty work at NAAMII under the supervision of [Dr. Binod Bhattarai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDEi58sAAAAJ). My research interests lie at the intersection of data privacy, robustness, and machine learning, with a particular focus on federated learning, self-supervised pre-training for limited data and the security of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Lately, I have been exploring client selection to improve convergence of semi-asynchronous federated learning.

Research Interests: Federated Learing, Robust Machine Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Distributed Optimization
